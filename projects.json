    "description": "I joined Sideline as the company’s first hire and the sole front end developer. In collaboration with the back end developer and the UX designer, I built this app from scratch. I created reusable components using Sass and used Angular to handle the complex user interactions necessary for gameplay and integrate with the back end API. While building Sideline, I learned the importance of developing a scalable architecture, and I took initiative to deepen my understanding of data structures to help me improve the reusability and maintainability of the code. From day one, I fully participated in ideation and UX design, so I learned quite a bit about the process of taking an app from conception to production. Sideline is now in the Apple and Google Play stores and has over 5,000 users.",

During that semester, our team of developers, designers, reporters, and videographers traveled to Cuba and created this interactive documentary site. I assisted with development throughout the entire site, but the photo galleries, interactive sliders, the Queens of Cuban Music interactive, the About page, and the blackout effect on desktop videos are primarily my code. I also assisted with setting up our custom CMS using Google Drive and Node.js and handled source control of the large team using Git.",

    "description": "This was a project built to help intermediate to advanced Japanese learners better study vocabulary. I built both the back end RESTful API using Laravel for storing vocab words and the front end quizzing app using Vue.js. This project taught me how to structure an API to best integrate it with a front end, as well as the considerations necessary to accomodate multilanguage text. I also learned best practices for writing documentation for an API and stretched my design skills to make this the most usable flashcard app for the needs of my niche audience.",

The app uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to allow users to create their own personalized roadtrip to multiple North Carolina State Parks, while calculating distance and time needed.
